# Disaster gremlin here!
Ello, am Sphx. I usually go by **Reed** on the internet but some irl peeps know me as *Noah*, either is fine.

### I have as much attention span as RAM on my first computer, A.K.A. I am functional, *barely*.

## Currently learning:
#### Programming:
- Python
- Ren'py ~~(which some may call just VN flavored python)~~
#### Languages:
- Chinese
- Japanese

## Hobbies  
Apart from "fucking around and finding out" I *do* have more things to spend my time on. Such as:  
- Rhythm Games
- Drawing (you can find me on krita-artists.org!)
- Writing
- Reading
- Being feral on misskey
